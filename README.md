Project Venus Overview

Project Venus is a decentralized authentication and asset creation system built on a custom hashgraph-based architecture. It integrates symbolic sigil solving as a proof-of-work mechanism to mint tokens and NFTs, forming a spiritually themed Web3 ecosystem.

Key Components:

1. Sigil-Based Proof-of-Work
	•	Users must generate or solve symbolic sigils to authenticate transactions or mint assets.
	•	This forms the core “ritual layer” of the platform, merging mysticism with cryptography.

2. Hashgraph Ledger Architecture
	•	Unlike traditional blockchain, Venus uses a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) system similar to Hedera Hashgraph for faster consensus and scalability.

3. Venus (VNS) Token
	•	A fixed-supply cryptocurrency (13,000,000 total).
	•	Only mintable through sigil authentication.

4. NFT Smart Contract System
	•	Each minted NFT includes:
	•	The sigil as a symbolic artifact
	•	Metadata linked to IPFS or decentralized storage
	•	Authenticated cryptographically via JW3 (a unique key type in the system)

5. Akashic Metadata Layer
	•	A distributed metadata vault akin to the Akashic Records—a symbolic, encrypted ledger of all activity and artifacts.

Applications:
	•	Spiritual Gaming / Quests: Solving sigils becomes a gamified rite-of-passage.
	•	Esoteric Marketplaces: Trade NFTs and tokens that have been “earned” spiritually and computationally.
	•	Decentralized Verification: All identities and assets are authenticated through symbolic interaction, not centralized IDs.

Visual & Design Aesthetic
	•	Logo: Based on celestial Venus symbolism, monogrammed, gender-neutral.
	•	Drawings: Patent-style black-and-white diagrams, showcasing nodes, interfaces, and data flow in a mystical but engineering-valid format.
